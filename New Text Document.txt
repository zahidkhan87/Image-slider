Saylani Progressive Web App Project (for batch 4):
We will build a mobile friendly Progressive Web App/Website for Saylani using React and Firebase. You will take the basic ideas from these two sites:
https://saylaniwelfare.com/
http://www.sujood.co/ 
Lets us find out who is the best developer in Saylani. The developer who will develop the best web app for Saylani will be invited to a one on one meeting and lunch with Maulana Muhammad Bashir Farooqui Qadri. The app will also be adopted for the official Saylani Web Site.
